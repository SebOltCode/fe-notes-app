# AI Diary Analysis Project

Welcome to the AI Diary Analysis Project repository! This project was developed as a one-week solo assignment, where the main framework was provided by the instructors, and my task was to implement various AI functionalities.

## Project Overview

### Objective
The primary objective of this project was to implement AI functionalities to:
1. Summarize text from diary entries.
2. Convert diary entries to speech.
3. Create a graphical mood barometer from various diary entries using the OpenAI API.

### Key Features
- **Text Summarization:** Uses AI to generate concise summaries of diary entries.
- **Speech Synthesis:** Converts the summarized text into speech, making it accessible as audio.
- **Mood Barometer:** Analyzes the sentiment of diary entries and visualizes the mood trends graphically.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenAI API:** For text summarization and sentiment analysis.
- **Proxied Server Communication:** Interaction with the OpenAI API is handled through a proxy server.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Frontend development for displaying and interacting with the diary entries.
- **Python/Flask:** Backend development for handling API requests and processing data.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the project interface.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the project interface.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for handling frontend logic.
- `server.py`: Python file for the Flask server to handle backend operations and API communication.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.
